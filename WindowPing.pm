=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Win32::Monitoring::WindowPing module provides a function to check if a
windows desktop window would be willing to respond to user input if there
was any. As a bonus there is a set of companion functions included, such
that you can implement a nice little window alive check program without
requiring further modules.

=over

=item $HWND=GetActiveWindows()

Returns the window handle of the currently active window on the window desktop

=item $status=PingWindow($HWND,$timeout_in_ms)

Determine is the window with the given HWND would react to user input. Return
after timeout. Status is one of the following

 WAS_ALIVE      - The windows reacts
 WAS_TIMEOUT    - No reaction within the timeout period
 WAS_NOTAWINDOW - The given HWND does not correspond to a window
 WAS_OTHERERROR - Something else went wrong check LastError

=item GetWindowCaption($HWND)

Get the caption of the window. The function will climb the window hierarchy
until it finds a window with a proper caption.

=item $PID=GetProcessIdForWindow($HWND)

Find the process id connected with this window.

=item GetNameForProcessId($PID)

Get the name of the binary for the process id.
